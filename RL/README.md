# Sample project: a citable reading list

This directory uses `CitableBase` to build a sample project to manage a citable reading list.

The code is identical to the code developed in the online user's guide [here](https://cite-architecture.github.io/CitableBase.jl/stable/).

You can run unit tests on the project, or read the user's guide and examine source code.  The user's guide and source code correspond as follows:

1. `src/page1_urn.jl` is the source for [Identification with URNs](https://cite-architecture.github.io/CitableBase.jl/stable/urns/)
2. `src/page2_citable.jl` is the source for [Citable objects](https://cite-architecture.github.io/CitableBase.jl/stable/citable/)
3. `src/page3_collection.jl` is the source for [Citable collections](https://cite-architecture.github.io/CitableBase.jl/stable/collections/)

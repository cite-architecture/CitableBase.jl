Learn how to use `CitableBase.jl` to define your own types of Citable objects, and even your own URN types.

The tutorials work through a hypothetical example to design a reading list of books citable by URN values. The first tutorial shows how to [implement a custom URN type](./diy-urn.qmd) for ISBN-10 numbers. The second tutorial then creates a [custom type of citable object](./diy-object.qmd) for books cited by ISBN-10 numbers.

Learn `CitableBase.jl`.

The guide works through a hypothetical example to design a reading list of books citable by URN values.  The guide first illustrates how to implement a custom URN type for ISBN-10 numbers. It then creates a custom citable object for books cited by ISBN-10 numbers, and finally defines a custom citable collection representing a reading list.

## More free stuff!

The `slidingwindow` function does what its name suggests: it creates a Vector of Vectors by sliding a window along a collection.  
```{julia}
using CitableBase
titles = map(bk -> bk.title, rl)
slidingwindow(titles)
```

It can also work directly on a citable collection.

```{julia}
slidingwindow(rl)
```


The `partitionvect` function partitions a Vector into a series of Vectors of a given size.  In contrast to `slidingwindow`, the elements in the new Vectors do not overlap.

`partitionvect` can work on any generic Vector.

```{julia}
v = collect(1:10)
partitionvect(v)
```

It also works on any citable collection.

```{julia}
partitionvect(rl)
```

# Implementations

## `Urn`

The CITE Architecture identifies only two kinds of fundamental URN.  They are implemented in Julia by:

- the `CtsUrn` type, in [CitableText.jl](https://github.com/cite-architecture/CitableText.jl)
- the `Cite2Urn` type, in [CitableObject.jl](https://github.com/cite-architecture/CitableObject.jl)


## `Citable`

The variety of potential citable resources is open ended.  For a current list of implementations of `Citable`, see the README for [the CitableBase.jl github repository](https://github.com/cite-architecture/CitableBase.jl).

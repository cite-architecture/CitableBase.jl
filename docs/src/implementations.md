# Implementations

## `Urn`

The CITE Architecture identifies only two kinds of fundamental URN.  They are implemented in Julia by:

- the `CtsUrn` type, in [CitableText.jl](https://github.com/cite-architecture/CitableText.jl)
- the `Cite2Urn` type, in [CitableObject.jl](https://github.com/cite-architecture/CitableObject.jl)



## `Citable`

The variety of potential citable resources is open ended.  This list will be updated as we become aware of other Julia implementations.

### Citable texts

- citable passage
- citable corpus
- citable physical text

Analyses of texts:

- citable analysis
- citable analyzed corpus


### Collections of objects

- citable object

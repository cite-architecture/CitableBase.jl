# CitableBase

The CitableBase module defines three core abstractions of the CITE architecture:

1. identifiers expressible using the syntax of the IETF URN specification
2. citable units, identified by URN, and including a human-readable label
3. comparison of individual citable units or collections of citable units using URN logic

The following pages:

1. illustrate how to implement type `Urn` type, type `Citable` type, and the `UrnComparisonTrait` 
2. list examples of implementations
3. document public functions and types of the `CitableBase` module

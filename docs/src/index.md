# CitableBase

The CitableBase module defines two core abstractions of the CITE architecture:

1. identifiers expressible using the syntax of the IETF URN specification
2. citable units, identified by URN, and including a human-readable label

The following pages:

1. illustrate how to implement a `Urn` and a `Citable`
2. list examples of implementations
3. document public functions and types of the `CitableBase` module
